# Image Extraction

LlamaParse `json` mode supports extracting any images found in a page object by using the `getImages` function. They are downloaded to a local folder and can then be sent to a multimodal LLM for further processing.

#### Indexing

You can create an index across both text and image nodes by requesting alternative text for the image from the multimodal LLM.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{CodeSource}</CodeBlock>

This uses two helper functions to create documents from the text and image nodes provided.

##### Text Documents

To create documents from the text nodes of the json object, we just map the needed values to a new `Document` object.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{CodeSource2}</CodeBlock>

##### Image Documents

To create documents from the images, we need to use a multimodal LLM to generate alt text. This is also where we actually use the `getImages` function.

For this we need to create `ImageNodes` and add them as part of our message.

We can use the `createMessageContent` function to simplify this.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{CodeSource3}</CodeBlock>
